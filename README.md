# Biter Breakout

Robotic Duo Trunks Jumpernaught and Francia Steelyhands have been locked up in hyperdimensional cube prison D-Cart 7 for operating a forklift without a permit.

Whilst eating their robot rations while attached to magnetized walls, a sudden crackle is heard, and both parties have their noon (or is it midnight) brunch violently disrupted.

> Trunks: Egads, mine fellow bucket of bolts! It doth appear our captors have suffered a most fortunate calamity :D
> 
> Francia: Beep bop bo boop.

The rusted cell door, stained with countless millenias worth of hot oil and transmission fluid, slowly slides open. Outside the cellblock, screams can be heard.

> Trunks: Well old bean, it does appear that we are free to escape. However we do seem
